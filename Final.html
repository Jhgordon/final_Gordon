                    <p>Often referred to as “New York’s College Team,” Syracuse Men’s Basketball typically falls under a lot of scrutiny. Their seasons go under the microscope, examined by Central Yorkers, and judged by many. After missing the NCAA Tournament in the 2021-22 season, fans and critics alike did not hold back in their complaints about SU. Saying the program is failing and cries for a new coaching staff have all been heard.  </p>

                    <p>The program is constantly changing but one thing has stayed constant for 46 years–Head Coach Jim Boeheim. Throughout his tenure as the coach of the Orange, Boeheim has handed his opponents over 1,000 losses, reached the Final Four five times, and won a national championship in 2003. The head man has certainly had a storied career leading the ‘Cuse but some question whether it’s time for him to call it quits. </p>
                    <p>In the five decades Boeheim has coached, the biggest change to the program occurred in 2013 when Syracuse transitioned from the Big East to the ACC. This conference shift has led to much stiffer competition as the ACC has been the premier college basketball conference in the nation. Playing better teams would usually indicate harder seasons, worse records, and less success. After missing the tournament and playing such a tough schedule, many the program is heading in the wrong direction. Well for Syracuse Men’s Basketball that might not be the Case…

                <h3 id="subhed">The Change</h3>
           <p>The strength of schedule rating is often discussed around the time of the NCAA Tournament. It’s used to compare teams’ schedules and analyze who played tougher competition. For the Orange, there’s has been much higher since joining the ACC. In their nine seasons in the conference Syracuse has averaged an 8.5 SOS rating, with two seasons above ten. In 35 years as a member of the Big East, SU averaged a 7.1 rating, with only one season over ten. The teams they’ve faced since joining the ACC have played at a much higher level.</p> 

           <p>Since the Orange joined the ACC, the conference has produced four different national champions. Louisville–2013, Duke–2015, North Carolina–2017, and Virginia–2019. These are teams that contend for national championships every year, that Syracuse plays at least once per season. Playing such strong competition leads to having a higher strength of schedule, and would usually mean winning less games. Syracuse has defied those expectations. </p>

                    <h3 id="subhed">The Results</h3>
                    <p>When taking a look at Syracuse’s high strength of schedule seasons, they don’t often result in low win totals. The graph above doesn’t show a pattern in terms of high SOS leading to lower wins. The graph shows that there’s no correlation between the two. Whether they’ve played harder or easier schedules, other things have factored into their win total. Take a look at Syracuse’s season with an SOS rating above 9. All of them resulted in seasons with at least 20 wins, with an average of 26. </p>
                    <p>Syracuse has shown they can win even when they play challenging competition. Basketball historian and analytic expert Jackson Hett believes other factors are at play when it comes to having a successful season. “A team’s success doesn’t solely rely on the schedule they play, variables like roster talent and coaching staff play a huge role, “ Hett said. When weighing the importance of the players on your squad versus the other team, anyone can win any given game. “It’s mainly about who goes out there and executes their own gameplan the best…you could be playing the best team in history but what it comes down to is if your team plays harder and wants it more,” Hett said. </p>

                    <h3 id="subhed">The Outlook</h3>
                    <p>Although Syracuse has shown they can win in the ACC, there’s still some uncertainty going forward. Jim Boeheim is entering his 47th season with the team and will be 78 years old in November. There’s no question he’s been an incredible coach throughout his whole career and through the ACC transition, but age will likely become more of a factor soon. </p>
                    <p>A program as historic as this one likely won’t have too much trouble transitioning after Boeheim. They showed they can win in the ACC, and beat the toughest competition in the nation. Many feared Syracuse couldn’t compete against teams in the ACC, but Boeheim and the rest of the Orange have proved them wrong. After missing the NCAA Tournament in the 2021-22 season, SU will have to bounce back and prove the nation wrong yet again.</p>
